<h4 class="section-header">Make a Box</h4>

<div class="section-container">

<p>For this box project, I wanted to make something similar to what we made in the lab, but ideally a bit bigger in size and with more personal design to make the box have character and resonate with things that I like. I thought, what better way to let people know the box is mine than putting my name on it?</p>

<div class="center-column">
<img class="project-img" src="assignment_2/lasercut_box_sketch.png" alt="Laser cut box sketch">
</div>

<p>On each side of the box, I have my name displayed. On the other sides, I have the words "bin" and "rules" so that it says "Dami's bin, Dami's rules" or if you read it the other way, "Dami's rules, Dami's bin." A nice addition to the box I made was inserting an SVG file of stars at the top of the lid to add a nice pattern.</p>

<p>I looked for dimensions for a small shoe box and used those dimensions to make the size of my box. These dimensions were 250mm x 165mm x 100mm, and it worked out pretty well in terms of size. I made the teeth parameters small enough to not stick out too much, but big enough for them to interlock when the piece was cut out.</p>

<div class="center-column">
<img class="project-img" src="assignment_2/lasercut_box_parameters.png" alt="Box parameters">
</div>

<p>When I printed my piece, the print took longer than expected, and I think it was because of the engraving part. I had a good bit of letters to engrave, as well as the stars.</p>

<div class="image-grid-2">

<img class="project-img" src="assignment_2/lasercut_box_2.jpg" alt="Laser cut box progress 2">
</div>

<p>The engraving wasn't as deep as I wanted it to be, so the letters weren't as visible as intended. Even the stars you could see, but not as prominent as I'd like them to be. This was a learning experience for me in terms of setting the engraving depth and being sure you know how deep it's going before issuing the print.</p>

<div class="image-grid-2">

<img class="project-img" src="assignment_2/lasercut_box_4.jpg" alt="Laser cut box progress 4">
</div>

<p>With the letters, I tried to account for reflection and the sides of the box flipping in order to connect the box pieces with the teeth, but I think the box's letters were still not oriented correctly. So when the print came out, some of my letters were upside down and some were oriented differently. This is another good lesson on orientation and what to expect when printing.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, my box was able to be made and it's an appropriate size for holding electronics and different lab devices. It came out fine and serves its purpose well.</p>

<h4 class="section-header">Fusion 360 Practice</h4>

<div class="section-container">

<p>For this practice session, I wanted to get experience through multiple rounds of iteration, doing the same thing over and over, no matter how simple or hard it was. My goal was to familiarize myself with the tools and layout of Fusion so that more complex designs wouldn't be an issue, and I wouldn't be bottlenecked by my lack of experience or knowledge of where functions are in the app.</p>

<p>For my first sketch, I made a duck - just a simple animal to practice curves, modeling more complex shapes with real-life anatomy, and trying to make shapes that aren't just offered natively in Fusion.</p>

<div class="center-column">
<img class="project-img" src="assignment_2/duck_sketch.png" alt="Duck sketch">
</div>

<p>After completing the sketch, I practiced simple extrusion to bring the 2D drawing into 3D space, creating a basic 3D duck model.</p>

<div class="center-column">

</div>

<p>Next, I decided to make something that was more applicable to me since I like making robots. I'm potentially interested in making a robotics project where I can voice control a rover, and if I want the robot, I have to build a chassis.</p>

<div class="center-column">
<img class="project-img" src="assignment_2/robot_skeleton_sketch.png" alt="Robot skeleton sketch">
</div>

<p>I decided to use the skills I knew already and make a robot chassis. The robot was designed as an inverted pendulum. I made the robot using my own design parts and imported some motors and wheels from GrabCAD to finish the chassis.</p>

<div class="center-column">
<img class="project-img" src="assignment_2/robot_3d_model.png" alt="Robot 3D model">
</div>

<p>This gave me a good heuristic prototype of what that rover would look like in construction, applying practical skills to a project I'm genuinely interested in pursuing.</p>

<h4 class="section-header">Real Life Fusion Modeling</h4>

<div class="section-container">

<p>For the real-life fusion modeling, I wanted to choose something that was in my room, but also something that had real-life use for me and that I often find myself using. So let's make it something I use in real life.</p>

<p>I chose to use something called a Parallette, which is a pair of low, portable bars designed to simulate gymnastics parallel bars. I often use them in calisthenics and gymnastics for bodyweight strength training and trying to learn different skills with some assistance of the bars. I use these a lot when I work on calisthenics moves since they're pretty helpful and alleviate the force I need to input through my hands.</p>

<div class="image-grid-2">
<img class="project-img" src="assignment_2/IRL_parallete_reference.jpg" alt="IRL parallette reference">
<img class="project-img" src="assignment_2/example_of_parallete_usage.jpg" alt="Example of parallette usage">
</div>

<p>You can do skills such as handstands, L-sits, and planches with the parallettes. Although they may look simple, they are very useful, and I thought, how about we design another one in case my current pair go missing? I can design another one and have a way to remake it.</p>

<p>I first started making the sketches by creating the trapezoidal holds for the parallette, then moved to the cylindrical extrusion that connects the holes.</p>

<div class="image-grid-2">
<img class="project-img" src="assignment_2/parallete_sketch_1.png" alt="Parallette sketch 1">
<img class="project-img" src="assignment_2/parallete_sketch_2.png" alt="Parallette sketch 2">
</div>

<p>Then I imported an M5x25 hex screw from GrabCAD and jointed the parallettes with the M5 screw.</p>

<div class="center-column">
<img class="project-img" src="assignment_2/M5X25.png" alt="M5x25 hex screw">
</div>

<p>After that, I made an outside extrusion wrapping for the cylindrical connector to emulate the fabric protection on the parallettes.</p>

<div class="image-grid-3">
<img class="project-img" src="assignment_2/parallelte_1.png" alt="Parallette design step 1">

<img class="project-img" src="assignment_2/parallelte_3.png" alt="Parallette design step 3">
</div>

<p>At the end, I applied the material properties for each part of the parallettes with the main base being pine wood and the black extrusion being a fabric cloth representing the wrapping of the parallettes.</p>

<p>After seeing the rendered view of the parallettes and my IRL parallettes, I am very content with how the modeling went. Quite frankly, it looks identical. So if I'm ever in need of a new pair of parallettes, I always know I have a file on deck to fabricate.</p>
