<h3>Final Project: Arduino Customizable Led Picture Frame</h3>
<div class="center-column">
<p id="project-description">
I want my final project to be a form of room augmentation, something that adds to my space but is also portable so I can use it wherever I go. I struggled to settle on a single utility because there are so many possibilities, which led me to a different idea. Instead of designing one fixed function, I wanted to make something customizable and open-ended.

The project is a customizable Arduino LED picture frame. The frame would be a standard 24 by 36 inches and filled with an LED grid. Each LED section would be separated by a laser cut grid made from one-eighth-inch basswood or possibly a 3D printed structure, with a diffuser layer placed over the grid to evenly disperse the light.

An Arduino would control the LEDs, allowing a user to connect their laptop or device and upload scripts that define what is displayed. These scripts could generate flowing light patterns, static designs such as drawings, or full animations that span the entire 24 by 36 inch frame.

The core appeal of this project is its customizability and open-ended nature. The picture frame is not tied to a single purpose. Depending on how I want to style my room or what I want displayed on the wall, the frame can be completely transformed through a simple script upload, making it both personal and reusable.
