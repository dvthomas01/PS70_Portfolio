<h4 class="section-header">Inspiration</h4>

<div class="section-container">

<p>For week 3's kinetic assignment, I admittedly was stumped on ideas and didn't know what to do. So I looked on the website for inspiration and was heavily drawn to Mila's <i>Stormy Seas</i> project, where she uses camshafts and an axle rod to make her kinetic sculpture.</p>

<p>Taking inspiration off that, I decided to think of a way I can use a similar mechanism, and I thought of a pretty popular trend that uses the same linear actuating motion, which was the <b>6-7 meme</b> that I've been spamming with my friends every day, so it felt natural to make a kinetic sculpture in honor of that.</p>

</div>

</div>

<h4 class="section-header">The Plan</h4>

<div class="section-container">

<p>With that in mind, and a strong reference for how the 6-7 meme would work and how it would look like in my kinetic sculpture, I went to start making the sketch for this project. I decided I would use a similar box structure and camshafts with the axle rod to get the linear actuating motion of the 6 and 7.</p>

<p>So I used cardboard and cut out these shapes in order to form the assembly.</p>

<h4 class="section-header">Hiccups I Faced</h4>

<div class="section-container">

<p>Once I made the assembly, I noticed a couple of... problems right off the bat. The pegs in the cams ideally would stay in contact while the axle would spin and just cause a linear motion, but problems such as the pegs slipping off of the cams and the rod holding up the numbers 6 and 7 were somewhat loose.</p>

<p>The rods were somewhat unrestrained in the direction they can move, causing the pegs to frequently slip off and making the motion unpredictable. So, I decided to improvise a bit and fix these issues. I added guardrails by using a bandaw to cut up wooden sticks into short pieces and attaching them to the pegs to prevent it from slipping off the side of the camshaft. I also went back and remodeling and made the holes holding up the numbers smaller so that I wouldn't have to worry about slipping of the numbers.</p>

<img class="project-img" src="assignment 3/peg.jpg" alt="Peg with guardrails to prevent slipping">
</div>

<p>Then I had to think of a way to find a way to connect the motor to the dowel that act as my rotating shaft. And similar to the Stormy Seas project, I cut out some circular pieces of cardboard that acted as shaft adapters to fit to the motor. This had mixed results because slippage was often an issue I faced here, and oftentimes you'd see the motor slipping out of the shaft.</p>

<div class="center-column">
<img class="project-img" src="assignment 3/side_view_for_shaft.jpeg" alt="Side view of motor-to-shaft connection attempt">
</div>

<p>Due to limited time, I wasn't able to fix this, but finding a better and more secure way to keep the motor not only connected to the shaft, but having the motor remain stationary so it doesn't wiggle out of the shaft is something I want to fix in this project.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="section-header">Final Result</h4>

<div class="section-container">

<p>With those main issues resolved temporarily, I was able to get the final version of my kinetic sculpture built and running. I was satisfied to see the 6-7 motion.</p>

<div class="image-grid-2">
<img class="project-img" src="assignment 3/final_view_1.jpg" alt="Final kinetic sculpture view 1">
<img class="project-img" src="assignment 3/final_view_2.jpg" alt="Final kinetic sculpture view 2">
</div>

<p>In future iterations, I would want to make the movement within the camshafts a bit more restrained so that unpredictable behavior and rotations are kept to a minimal, and maybe 3D print a shaft adapter for the motor rather than using cardboard to reduce slippage.</p>
